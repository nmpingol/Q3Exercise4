	<p>The Stilts Calagatan Activities Center is a resort in Calagatan, Batangas. My family and I visited this resort during summertime last year to celebrate my grandfather's birthday. We stayed there for only 2 days, but I enjoyed every hour of it! After breakfast at McDo, we arrived at the resort and we were escorted to our rooms. It was a pretty cottage, it felt very homey and cozy. Right in front of our cottage was a park where there were tree houses and swings. My brother and I played there as if we aren't 14 and 16 years old haha. We got to swim in a swimming pool first, then we went to swim at the beach! Both were very fun, but I missed feeling sand and seeing the actual sea in person. I did usual beach activities like bury my feet in sand to look like a mermaid, try to find seashells (there wasn't a lot :<), and pretend like I am Moana. It was nice to hang out at the beach while the tide is still low, it sort of felt like a fever dream to stay so far from shore but not drown.</p>
	<p>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*</p>
	<p>Activities: <br> Aside from swimming, there were many other things to do. One of my favorite things about summer staycations is breakfast. I'm not a big foodie, but I like the combination of good breakfast and pretty scenery around to enjoy. There was also a shuttle service, it may not seem like much but I enjoy riding around the resort and seeing different sights. There was also a playground, luckily I got to hang out there when there weren't a lot of people so I wouldn't be embarassed, haha.</p>

	<p>There was also a service that offered to have this little setup prepared for your family to eat dinner. My family did this in celebration of my grandfather's birthday! It was such a nice experience to eat together with family as you watch the sun set. However, it rained. I would love to say that the rain gods were in our favor at that time, cause the rain only started once we were finished eating. A little chaos to your staycation is what makes it fun. <br> There were also other activities or places. I saw that there was a motorbike activity, but my mom didn't let me try it. </p>
	<p>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*</p>
	<p>Random Anectdotes: <br> There was a wishing well! My grandmother, mom, and I all made a wish at the same time. And there were many little details to appreciate at the resort. Like the flowers or handpainted signs. When it was night time, I was super tired so I was the first one to sleep. While I slept, my family played bingo haha. The whole resort felt like something you would see in animal crossing. I took some inspiration for my own island. <br> To conclude, I came home with sand in my shoes, things, and other inconvenient places. Thank you for reading! </p>
